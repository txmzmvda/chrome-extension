## Desc

It is basing mostly on JS, a little bit of styling and HTML base. It is working a little bit like bookmarks. 
Via this extension you are able to save leads (websites) - both currently open and active tabs and alos the ones you'll write by yourself.

After deploying it is working properly on Google Chrome.

I have no copyrights for this one - it was done only for educational purpouse.
